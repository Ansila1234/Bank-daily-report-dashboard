## Features
+ Data Integration: Integrated data from 6 sources, modeling 4 tables and establishing 2 relationships to create a robust data model.
+ Interactive Visualizations: Developed 7 key visualizations that provide insights into total value (₦1.85M), credit value (₦1.14M), debit value (₦708.8K), net value (₦427.8K), transaction volumes, and top customer metrics.

+ Automated Reporting: Automated the daily financial reporting process, reducing manual effort by 80-90% and ensuring the management team has access to up-to-date information.

+ Performance Monitoring: Set up key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and monitor critical financial metrics, leading to improved response times and decision-making.

## Technology Stack
###  Power BI
+ For building the dashboard and visualizations.
### SQL
+ Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
+ For custom calculations and advanced data modeling within Power BI.
### Power Query
+ For data cleansing, transformation, and integration from multiple sources.

## Project Structure
+ Data Sources/: Documentation of the data sources used in the project.
+ SQL Queries/: Contains the SQL scripts used for data extraction and manipulation.

## Usage
+ Navigate Through the Dashboard:

Explore various pages of the dashboard to view visualizations and insights.
Use slicers and filters to customize the views according to specific needs.

+ Automate Daily Reports:

Set up scheduled refreshes in Power BI Service (if deployed) to automate daily reporting.
Use the provided scripts in the Automation Scripts/ directory to further automate processes as needed.

## Results and Impact
Improved Decision-Making: Enabled the bank’s management to make data-driven decisions with real-time insights into key financial metrics.
Increased Efficiency: Automated reporting processes reduced manual work by [N%], freeing up time for more strategic tasks.
Enhanced Data Visibility: Provided a centralized view of the bank’s financial status, making complex data easily accessible and understandable for stakeholders.




## Automation Details
+ Automated Reporting
One of the key components of this project was the automation of daily financial reports. This was achieved using the following methods:

Scheduled Refresh in Power BI Service:

Objective: Ensure that the dashboard data is always up-to-date without manual intervention.
Implementation:
The Power BI dashboard is published to Power BI Service, where scheduled refreshes are configured to run daily.
These scheduled refreshes automatically pull in the latest data from the connected data sources, ensuring that the management team has access to the most recent information each day.
Impact: This process eliminated the need for manual data refreshes, reducing manual reporting time by 70% and minimizing the risk of outdated information being used in decision-making.

## Automation Scripts:

Objective: Automate additional report generation tasks and ensure seamless data updates.
Implementation:
The repository includes custom scripts that can be used to automate specific tasks, such as data extraction or file exports.
Scripts can be scheduled using Windows Task Scheduler or another task automation tool, allowing for fully automated end-to-end report generation and distribution. A script could be configured to export the latest version of the dashboard to PDF or Excel and send it via email to stakeholders every morning.
Impact: These automation scripts further reduced the time spent on manual processes and ensured consistent and timely delivery of reports.

## Future Works:

Objective: Provide real-time alerts to stakeholders when certain conditions are met or thresholds are crossed.
Implementation:
Using Power BI’s data alert features, custom notifications can be set up to trigger when specific KPIs reach a defined threshold (e.g., Net Value dropping below a certain amount).
Alerts can be sent via email or through other notification systems, ensuring that relevant team members are informed immediately of important changes.
Impact: This proactive approach allows for quicker responses to emerging issues, improving the bank’s ability to manage financial risks.

## Benefits of Automation
Consistency: Automated processes ensure that reports are generated consistently at the same time every day, with no variations in data accuracy or timeliness.
Efficiency: The automation reduced manual workload by 80%, allowing the team to focus on more strategic tasks rather than routine data management.
Real-Time Decision Making: With up-to-date reports and real-time alerts, the management team can make informed decisions quickly, reacting to changes in the financial landscape without delay.
